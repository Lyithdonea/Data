# Lyithdonea: The Azurian Isles
by Melchior Dahrk

### Disclaimer
Lyithdonea is currently in an ALPHA state which means that the mod is still very incomplete. You will encounter bugs, performance issues, and missing content. Proceed to install and play at your own risk.

### Description
_Lyithdonea: The Azurian Isles_ is a landmass mod for Morrowind featuring a tropical paradise between Tamriel and Akavir. The mod has a strong influence from the Daedric Lord Azura with dusk and dawn themes and Azura being the focus of religion in the region. Explore a detailed new landmass, discover strange creatures, battle pirates, immerse in the lore and much yet to come!

### Getting Started
To get to Lyithdonea, talk with someone on Azura’s Coast (such as in Sadrith Mora or Tel Branora) about “Latest Rumors”.

### Requirements
**Morrowind - Tribunal - Bloodmoon - [OAAB_Data](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042) - [Tamriel_Data](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537)**

### Recommended Mods
* **[Morrowind Optimization Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384)** - It is highly recommended that you install MOP to improve performance with this mod.
* **[Project Atlas](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399) - It is highly recommended that you use Project Atlas. This will significantly improve performance in the main city in particular.
* **[Better Waterfalls](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45424)** - This mod includes custom waterfalls which are designed to match this replacer.
